# Ei Coding Test

## Instructions
Download a copy of this repo to start. When finished, please create a github repository and share the URL with us.

Documentation and Testing are quite important.

Please use Node.js for the backend components, and any tools / framework you choose for the frontend. 


# Test #1: Node JS

Using the open "API" provided here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## Challenge #1

Create a console application that loops through all 100 of the "/posts" records and outputs a summary which summarizes the count of each letter and character found in the "title" and "body" attributes of all 100 posts.

## Challenge #2

Create a console application that loops through all 100 of the "/posts" records and "reads them back" to the user, outputting one word per post with a delay of 1 second between each letter.

## Challenge #3

Create a basic webpage to display the data. Feel free to implement an advanced implementation of this which would allow a user to manipulate the data in some way (such as hiding records, adding records, or editing records).
